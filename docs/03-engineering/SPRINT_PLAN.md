- Build agent registry and routing system
- Load agents dynamically based on domain config

---

### ✅ Sprint 7: Real-World Agents (Week 13–14)
- Implement 2–3 vertical-specific agents:
    - GymBot (fitness plan)
    - TutorBot (education assistant)
    - RealEstateBot (property Q&A)

---

### ✅ Sprint 8: Auth + RBAC (Week 15–16)
- Google OAuth + JWT-based sessions
- Role scoping: Admin, Developer, User
- Access control at gateway + agent level

---

### ✅ Sprint 9: OSS Packaging (Week 17–18)
- Build CLI for local testing

- Test calls from dashboard → backend

---

### ✅ Sprint 11: Logs + Metrics (Week 21–22)
- Log tool usage and API call outcomes
- Add visual charts and error reports
- Email/webhook alerts on failures

---

### ✅ Sprint 12: SaaS Foundations (Week 23–24)
- Stripe (sandbox) for billing
- Project-based multitenancy

## 🧠 Design Principles

- Hands-on learning over theoretical planning
- Focus on modularity, observability, and developer experience
- Build for enterprise-grade extensibility, not just MVPs
- Think like a Staff Engineer from Day 1
