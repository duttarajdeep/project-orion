# 🌌 Project Orion – Vision

**Why Orion?**

The future of human-computer interaction is conversational. As LLMs become the interface to everything, we need infrastructure that lets them act — securely, reliably, and with real business context.

## 🧭 What Orion Aims To Be

A modular, pluggable **MCP server platform** that enables businesses to expose APIs to LLMs across different ecosystems (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) — securely and intelligently.
